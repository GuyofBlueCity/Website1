This is a CDI made as a way for students of NIT Trichy to access concerns related to their academia, schedules and own personal notes to take down to make it easier and integrate better into a digital space. However, this has been only partially made due to my own lack of expertise and knowledge in website development

LOGIN
Currently there is no user set up yet that can login to the website yet and has to be updated in the code. However, it will feasibly go to the home page after so. There also exists a link to the forget password page below

HOME PAGE
Here is where the main page of the website exists which you will be able to access the other domains of the website such as the diary, calendar, announcements and assignments. There is also a footer present at the bottom with contact info is the user wishes to bring up any problem

DIARY
Here. you can jot down any personal notes down in the text box along with the title which will then be stored down below. However, due to lack of knowledge on my part, after refreshing the page, the entries will disappear due to no code storing the entries in a memory to store permanently 

CALENDAR
Here, you'll be able to access the class time schedule. Currently there is only the upcoming II year CSE students schedule put in place for now

ASSIGNMENT & ANNOUNCEMENTS
Unfortunately, I was stuck on how to implement a system that would update the website regularly for these pages and thus was unable to set up a proper page for them
